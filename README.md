## Overview

FAQ Webpage with accordion card. We are provided with the mobile and desktop design of the webpage and we have to build it according to the design. This is a cool project that we can use in the future incase we need to add a FAQ section to any of our websites.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

### Continued development

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Aligning_Items_in_a_Flex_Container) -  This helped me for aligning items in a flex container. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.

- [Example resource 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2993851/how-to-remove-an-element-from-the-flow) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to remove an element from the flow of our document. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
